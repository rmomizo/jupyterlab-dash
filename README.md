# jupyterlab-dash-dev-fork

Note: this fork is being used to create a plotly dash environment in Jupyter labs that will launch dash apps from Binder. 

All original jupyterlab-dash files are the products of plotly/jupyerlab-dash and can be found at (https://github.com/plotly/jupyterlab-dash). Original dash apps found in this repository are built on Plotly Dash and Plotly Dash Cytoscape libraries. See the following licenses:
